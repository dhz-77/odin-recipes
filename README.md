# odin-recipes

The current project is a HTML website tutorial in form of an exemplary recipe website linking to different sub websites of different recipes.

The skills to be demonstrated in this project are basic structuring of an HTML website including the correct use of directories, as well as making use of appropriate HTML elements and attributes. One of the fundamental functions of the website is its reference to other sites using links via hypertext-references (href).

At the end of the project, it is to be pushed to the remote GitHub repository using the workflow discussed in the previous Odin chapters. If changes to the project are being made, they should be committed in correct form and finally pushed to the remote repository.
