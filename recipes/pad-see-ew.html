            <li>1 (8 ounce) package wide rice noodles</li>
            <li>1 cup bite size broccoli pieces</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crushed garlic</li>
            <li>½ pound rib-eye steak, sliced thin</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the dry rice noodles in a bowl, cover with hot water, and let soak until white and soft but not mushy, <br> 
                about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a small pot of water to a boil; cook the broccoli in the boiling water until cooked and still firm, <br> 
                5 to 7 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. <br>
                Stir in the sliced steak; cover the skillet and cook until the meat is just turning from pink to grey, <br> 
                5 to 7 minutes. Whisk the water and cornstarch together in a bowl; pour into the skillet along with the <br>
                oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, and sugar. Add the rice noodles and broccoli and stir to mix evenly. <br> 
                Season with salt and pepper. Allow the mixture to simmer while you prepare the egg.</li>
            <li>Prepare a small skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat. Cook the egg in the prepared skillet <br>
                until cooked through and the yolk is solid. Add the cooked egg to the other skillet and stir to incorporate. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
